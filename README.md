# Super simple form validation with JS and HTML

This project aims to create a web page using JavaScript and HTML to collect user information through a form. The collected data is then sent to a specified server URL using the HTTP POST method. Below are the key requirements and assumptions for this project:

| Requirement                                                | Details                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Input Fields**                                     | The web page includes input fields for the following:      |
| - Name                                                    | - Phone Number                                               |
| - Birth Date                                              | - Favorite Pastime                                          |
| **Phone Number Field**                                    | The phone number field allows any prefix codes.            |
| **Birth Date Validation**                                  | The birth date field is validated for the correct format.   |
| **Favorite Pastime Field**                                | The favorite pastime field allows selecting from a specific list of options, including Surfing the Web, Playing Sport, Listening to Music, Watching TV, Playing Games, Community Service, Daydreaming, Reading, or Meditation. |
| **Data Transmission**                                      | The form data is sent to the specified server URL using the HTTP POST method. |
| **Data Assumptions**                                       | Reasonable assumptions are made about the content and format of the data, and these assumptions are enforced within the web page. |
